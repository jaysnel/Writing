## Introduction
GMX is a decentralized exchange protocol that operates on both Arbitrum and Avalanche networks. It is popular for many investors due to its 50x leverage and the fact that it does not require a registration process or an account to use, only a wallet. This technical documentation provides instructions on setting up a wallet and interacting with short and long buys of Ethereum using the GMX platform.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the setup and usage of GMX, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

* MetaMask wallet installed with ETH.

If MetaMask is not installed, download it as a browser extension from https://metamask.io/.

## Wallet Setup and Configuration

Bridging ETH to Arbitrum
Ensure that your MetaMask wallet contains ETH and is connected to the Arbitrum One network.
