# How to Use the Demu Web3 Jukebox Player: Purchase and Play Music

Welcome to Demu, a platform made for musical geniuses. Demu is a platform where artists can be their own bank, streaming platform, and record store, all in one. Artists can sell content directly to their supporters with no middleman, and in return, true fans get direct access to the artists.

If you are an artist and looking to create content in a decentralized way and get paid directly for your work, you can reach out on [Discord](http://discord.gg/rgBTv6cTfb). More formal steps will be provided later.

If you are looking to support your favorite artists and have a more personal experience with them, here is a guide to using Demu Jukebox. You can also visit [Demu's website](https://www.demu.pro/) to read the litepaper along with seeing who the team is.

## Getting Started

- Visit [Demu's website](https://www.demu.pro/) to explore.
- Click on "Buy Music on Jukebox."
- Click "Choose Wallet" in the upper right corner and select whichever you prefer. Make sure to sign the transaction, and then you are now free to start browsing music.

## Browsing Music

- **Desktop**: Options will appear on the lefthand side.
- **Mobile**: Options will appear at the bottom right.

These options allow you to view your music store or the current Demu Classic NFT for purchase.

Scroll through to find your favorite artist. Once you find them, you can click "Buy Album" to take you directly to purchase the album or you can click the image to take you to the music player for your selection.

## Purchasing an Album

If you choose to "Buy Album," you will come to the following screen where you can view the tracks and make the purchase. Ensure you have enough ADA in your wallet and select "Buy Now." Once you do this, sign your transaction and wait for it to complete. If everything goes well, you will get a confirmation.

## After Purchase

Assuming you have enough ADA in your wallet, once you have completed your purchase you will be given an NFT to your wallet and you should see the following:

## Music Player

If you decide to go to the music player, you can either buy the album, which will take you to the above, or you have the option to purchase the rights to play the song, which costs about 2 ADA, or buy the entire album. Once your transaction goes through, you will be free to listen as much as you want! You will also receive an NFT in the wallet you used for purchase, which can be used for verification later on.

With support for the artists, this will allow you as a fan to become eligible for VIP access to special content, early releases, artist tokens, and more.
