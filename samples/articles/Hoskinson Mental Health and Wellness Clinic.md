# From Vision to Reality: Hoskinson Mental Health and Wellness Clinic

> On average, it takes 10 years for research to trickle down into mainstream medical practice. That’s too long. We’ve disconnected from the system to be more agile in our approach and care, tapping into cutting-edge research that makes it clear the old way of doing things isn’t doing us any favors.

After visiting the suicide capital of the world, Gillete WY, Charles went to a local high school where he discovered signs in the school stating, “Don’t kill yourself” that was directed towards the students…..THE STUDENTS….I can only imagine. On top of that, the city suffers from nutritional issues, obesity and cancer problems. After this visit, Charles decided he wanted to do more in the healthcare space. He began building a new clinic for excellence within the city to help those in need.

With the opening of the Hoskinson Clinic, Co-founder and CEO Charles Hoskinson has set out to change this with a new ideology. He wants to make sure that the people come first and to improve both the physical and mental health of others. And I think we can all attest that, the current US healthcare system does not have our best interests at heart. He will also be making sure the employees are taken care of just as well, offering higher than average wages, full benefits, and access to state-of-the-art equipment.

Equipped with a brand-new facility, a vision and the ability to accept ADA token as payment, this is shaping up to be an incredible experience for everyone involved.

## THE FACILITY
Until the new site is fully completed, which sits at 201 W Lakeway Road, Suite 800, Gillete, WY 82718, the clinic will be using a temporary location and already has 2,000 patients. In the latest AMA with Charles which you can find here, he states that we can expect the new facility to be incredibly beautiful with 10,000 square feet (about twice the area of a basketball court) of space, terrazzo floors, coffered ceilings, soundproof exam rooms, statues, art and more.

They are also preparing to start bringing in new, state-of-the-art equipment once the building is fully completed such as new CT scans, PET modules and even a Magstim. With the plans to also build out a pharmacy as well, they have already built 2 updated procedure rooms and extended the hallways to transport patients easier. This new equipment and changes to the building structure should give staff access to everything they may need to conduct research, help patients, and allow patients to move around with more ease.

## SERVICES
The Health & Wellness Clinic will be able to service a variety of areas and accept a variety of insurance providers. Both are expected to grow as the clinic grows. But, for now, the clinic is expected to be able to help you with:

* Primary care
* Mental health care
* Women’s health
* Proactive Health Screenings
* Cancer screenings
* Diet / Nutritional Medicine
* Cardiovascular Care
* 
The Health & Wellness Clinic will accept the following insurance providers with the expectation this list could grow with time:
1. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Wyoming
2. Medicare
3. Medicaid
4. United health
5. Mountain Health Co-op
6. First Choice Health
7. Cigna
8. Humana

## PAYMENT
Something many are excited about is the ability to use ADA as payment. Not only will the clinic accept the standard debit/credit methods, but you will also have the option settle any services with the Cardano native token ADA. Giving you the potential to save on fees, increasing security of payments, and will help expand the reach of the clinic which could attract patients from all over the world.

## CONCLUSION
As the Hoskinson Mental Health and Wellness Clinic continues to grow, it’s obvious that this is a game changer in the world of healthcare. With a focus on cutting-edge research, patient health as a priority and the ability to accept ADA token as payment, the clinic is ready to improve the lives of patients and staff alike. And as Charles Hoskinson notes, it’s time for a change in the healthcare industry — one that brings us closer to the forefront of technological innovation. With this facility, that future is closer than ever, and I have no doubt that it will be a success!
