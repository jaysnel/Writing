# Introduction
GMX is a decentralized exchange protocol that operates on both Arbitrum and Avalanche networks. It is popular for many investors due to its 50x leverage and the fact that it does not require a registration process or an account to use, only a wallet. This technical documentation provides instructions on setting up a wallet and interacting with short and long buys of Ethereum using the GMX platform.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the setup and usage of GMX, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

* MetaMask wallet installed with ETH.

If MetaMask is not installed, download it as a browser extension from https://metamask.io/.

# Wallet Setup and Configuration
## Add Arbitrum Network to MetaMask Wallet
1. Visit https://chainlist.org/ and click “Connect Wallet.”
2. Follow the on-screen instructions within MetaMask to connect your wallet.
3. Scroll or use the search bar to find “Arbitrum One” and click “Connect Wallet.”
4. Follow the directions within MetaMask to complete the network connection.

## Bridging ETH to Arbitrum
1. Ensure that your MetaMask wallet contains ETH and is connected to the Arbitrum One network.
2. Visit https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ and click “Connect Wallet” in the upper right-hand corner.
3. If your MetaMask account is still set to Ethereum, it will prompt you to switch to Arbitrum. Follow the on-screen instructions in MetaMask to allow Arbitrum to bridge.
