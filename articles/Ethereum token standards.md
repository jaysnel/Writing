# Cryptocurrencies and Ethereum Token Standards Overview

Cryptocurrencies have changed the world of finance, but **Ethereum** has really led the movement. With its first mover's advantage, Ethereum introduced the concept of tokens, which can represent a wide range of assets and are used in various blockchain-based applications. In this article, I’ll give a simple overview of the **3 essential Ethereum token standards**: **ERC20**, **ERC721**, and **ERC777**, along with a few pros/cons for each.

And like always, if you enjoy the article, give it a clap and follow!

## ERC20: The Fungible Token Standard

**ERC20 tokens** are the most common and well-understood in the blockchain space. The term **“ERC20”** stands for **“Ethereum Request for Comment 20.”** These tokens are **fungible**, meaning that each token is identical and interchangeable with any other token of the same type. If you have two ERC20 tokens from the same project, they are always of equal value.

Here is a simplified example of an ERC20 token contract:

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ERC20Token {

    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;

    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {
        // Transfer logic here
    }
    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {
        // Approval logic here
    }
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {
        // Transfer from logic here
    }
}
```

### Pros
- **Widespread Adoption**: ERC20 is the most common token standard in the blockchain space. Its popularity means that many wallets, exchanges, and platforms support ERC20 tokens, enhancing their liquidity and accessibility.
- **Simplicity**: ERC20 token contracts tend to be relatively straightforward, making them accessible for developers, especially those new to blockchain development.
- **Interoperability**: ERC20 tokens can easily interact with other smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps), enabling a wide range of use cases beyond simple transfers.

### Cons
- **Lack of Native Support**: While Ethereum’s ERC20 standard is widely adopted, it isn’t native to the Ethereum blockchain. This can lead to potential security risks if token contracts aren’t thoroughly audited.
- **Uniformity Requirement**: The fungibility of ERC20 tokens means they may not be suitable for representing unique, indivisible assets like digital art or collectibles.

## ERC721: The Non-Fungible Token Standard

**ERC721 tokens**, also known as **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**, are unique and indivisible tokens. Each token represents something distinct, making them perfect for assets like digital art, collectibles, and in-game items.

Here’s a simplified example of an ERC721 token contract:

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract ERC721Token is ERC721, Ownable {

    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol) ERC721(_name, _symbol) {
    }

    uint256 public tokenCounter;

    function mint(address to) public onlyOwner {
        // Minting logic here
    }
}
```
### Pros
- **Scarcity and Ownership**: Each ERC721 token has a distinct value and can represent true ownership of a specific item or asset in the digital world.
- **Diverse Use Cases**: The uniqueness of ERC721 tokens has given rise to a wide range of creative applications, including digital art marketplaces, virtual real estate, and blockchain-based games.
- **Customization**: Developers have significant flexibility in designing ERC721 contracts, allowing them to tailor tokens to specific project requirements.

### Cons
- **Complexity**: ERC721 contracts tend to be more complex than ERC20 contracts due to the need to manage unique identifiers for each token. This complexity can pose challenges for new developers.
- **Limited Interchangeability**: ERC721 tokens are not easily interchangeable with each other or with ERC20 tokens. This limitation can impact liquidity and the ability to use them in broader ecosystems.
- **Higher Gas Costs**: Transactions involving ERC721 tokens can be more expensive in terms of gas fees compared to ERC20 transactions, potentially affecting the cost-effectiveness of certain applications.

## Enter ERC777: The Proposed Token Standard

**ERC777** is a proposed token standard that aims to enhance token functionality on the Ethereum blockchain. One of its key features is the ability to perform all token operations in a single transaction, potentially reducing transaction overhead and improving efficiency.

While there are no concrete code examples for ERC777 yet, it promises to simplify token transactions and introduce features like address blacklisting for added security.

## Conclusion

Ethereum’s versatility is shown through its various token standards:
- **ERC20** tokens provide fungibility.
- **ERC721** tokens offer uniqueness.
- **ERC777**, once implemented, could streamline token operations.

These standards enable developers to build a wide range of blockchain-based applications, from cryptocurrencies to digital collectibles. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, staying informed about these standards is key to growth, whether you’re a developer or a cryptocurrency enthusiast.
