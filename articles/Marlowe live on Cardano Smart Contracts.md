# Marlowe: A New Era for Smart Contracts on Cardano

Today marks the day that Marlowe, a safe and intuitive platform for creating and deploying smart contracts, is now live on the Cardano mainnet for early adopters! This marks a significant step forward in the evolution of blockchain technology in the already exciting Cardano ecosystem. So let's go over why this is so important.

## Prioritizing Safety

One of the critical aspects of Marlowe is its focus on safety. The platform has undergone rigorous internal and external auditing giving an increased level of assurance for a safe environment for contract use on the mainnet. Notably, Marlowe leverages the power of Plutus, offering strong assurances through formal proofs, extensive testing, and comprehensive analysis tools.

## Built-in Guardrails

Marlowe Playground offers an innovative simulator environment. This gives users the ability to thoroughly test their contracts before deploying them with real funds on the mainnet. This essential feature will offer users peace of mind and ensure their contracts are fully optimized and secure before launching.

## Accessibility and User-Friendliness

In an effort to make smart contracts accessible to a wider audience, Marlowe provides comprehensive tutorials, guides, and best practices. With compatibility with JavaScript and Haskell, Marlowe is set up for seamless integration of smart contracts into decentralized applications (DApps). This will undeniably empower developers and broaden the potential applications of blockchain technology.

## Speed and Efficiency

Marlowe stands out for its efficiency and speed. It comes equipped with reusable contract templates and intuitive integration with Marlowe Runtime APIs, making it an ideal tool for developers looking to build within the Cardano ecosystem. This will undoubtedly simplify the process and reduce the time needed to create and deploy smart contracts.

## Smart Contract Creation

Marlowe joins the rapidly expanding suite of languages and tools available on Cardano. It provides a complete toolkit for creating, deploying, and monetizing smart contracts, making it perfect for both the Web3 community and newcomers. This inclusivity embodies the spirit of Cardano's vision of democratizing blockchain technology.

## Conclusion

But this is just the start of the Marlowe journey! The Cardano team I am sure are eager to collaborate with developers for feedback on usability, documentation, user experience, and much more.
