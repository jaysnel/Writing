# Getting Started with Coinbase Wallet: A Guide to Self-Custody

Cryptocurrency offers you financial independence, but it also comes with the responsibility of managing your own assets. A self-custody wallet like **Coinbase Wallet** gives you full control over your crypto. Unlike exchange wallets, where third parties hold your funds, Coinbase Wallet puts the ownership directly in your hands.

## Part 1: Setting Up Coinbase Wallet

### Step 1: Download Coinbase Wallet

**Mobile users:**
- Go to your device’s app store (Google Play Store for Android, or App Store for iOS).
- Search for “Coinbase Wallet” and download the app.

**Desktop users:**
- Go to [wallet.coinbase.com](https://wallet.coinbase.com).
- Download the browser extension for Chrome or Firefox.

> **Important:** Coinbase Wallet is separate from the Coinbase exchange app. Make sure you’re downloading Coinbase Wallet to have full control of your private keys and assets.

### Step 2: Create a New Wallet
1. Open the Coinbase Wallet app and tap **“Create a new wallet.”**
2. **Set up a username**: This is your public identifier within the wallet ecosystem. Keep in mind that this name can be shared with others to receive funds but does not expose your private keys or sensitive data.
3. **Backup your seed phrase**:
   - You’ll be shown a 12-word seed phrase. This phrase is the key to accessing your wallet.
   - Write it down physically and store it in a secure place (avoid storing it digitally). If you lose access to your device, this phrase is the only way to recover your wallet.
   - Do not share this phrase with anyone. If someone gains access to it, they can control your assets.
4. **Set a strong password**: After backing up the seed phrase, you’ll be prompted to set a password for app access. Make sure it’s strong and unique to ensure your wallet is secure.

> **Note:** If you lose both your seed phrase and your password, you will permanently lose access to your funds.

### Step 3: Fund Your Wallet

To trade crypto, you need to add funds to your wallet.

#### Receive crypto from an external source:
- If you already own crypto on an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, or any other platform, you can transfer funds to your Coinbase Wallet.
- Tap **“Receive”** in the wallet app and choose the cryptocurrency you want to deposit (e.g., Ethereum).
- You’ll see your wallet’s public address. Copy this and use it in your external exchange’s withdrawal option.

#### Buy crypto directly in the wallet:
- If you don’t own any crypto yet, you can buy it directly within the Coinbase Wallet using a debit card or bank transfer.
- Tap on the **“Buy”** button, select the asset you want to purchase, and follow the instructions to link your payment method.

Now that your wallet is funded, you’re ready to make your first trade!

## Part 2: Making Your First Trade

### Step 1: Understand Trading on a Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

Coinbase Wallet allows you to trade crypto directly through decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or by swapping tokens within certain networks, such as **Base**, a layer-2 network developed by Coinbase. You can swap crypto assets in two ways:
- Using decentralized applications (dApps) like Uniswap.
- Swapping native assets on Base directly through the wallet, without interacting with a dApp browser.

Let’s start with the easiest method, which is using the native swapping feature within the Base network.

### Step 2: Swapping Native Assets on Base
1. **Open Coinbase Wallet**:
   - Navigate to your asset list within the wallet interface, and ensure your funds are on the Base network (if they aren’t, you can bridge your assets to Base from Ethereum or other networks).
2. **Select the Swap Option**:
   - Tap on the **“Swap”** button, typically visible in the wallet’s main interface.
3. **Choose the Tokens to Swap**:
   - In the **“From”** field, select the cryptocurrency you want to swap (e.g., ETH on Base).
   - In the **“To”** field, choose the asset you want to receive (e.g., USDC, DAI, etc.).
4. **Enter the Amount**:
   - Type in the amount of crypto you wish to swap. Coinbase Wallet will automatically calculate the estimated amount of the token you’ll receive and display the current market rate.
5. **Review Gas Fees and Details**:
   - Ensure that you have enough ETH on the Base network to cover gas fees, which are typically lower on layer-2 networks like Base.
   - Double-check the transaction details and ensure you’re comfortable with the swap rate and gas fees.
6. **Confirm the Swap**:
   - Tap **“Swap”** to proceed and confirm the transaction in the app.

> **Tip:** Using Base for swaps is a great way to avoid high gas fees, especially compared to Ethereum’s mainnet.

### Step 3: Using Uniswap via Coinbase Wallet (Optional)
1. **Open the dApp Browser in Coinbase Wallet**:
   - In the mobile app, tap on the browser icon (often labeled as **“DApp”** or **“Browser”**).
   - In the desktop extension, click the dApp browser option.
2. **Go to Uniswap**:
   - In the browser, search for Uniswap or type in the URL: [https://app.uniswap.org](https://app.uniswap.org).
3. **Connect Coinbase Wallet to Uniswap**:
   - On Uniswap, click **“Connect Wallet”** and select **“Coinbase Wallet”** from the list.
   - Approve the connection in your Coinbase Wallet app.
4. **Select Your Trade**:
   - In the **“From”** field, select the cryptocurrency you currently hold (e.g., Ethereum).
   - In the **“To”** field, select the token you want to swap for (e.g., USDC).
5. **Confirm the Swap**:
   - Review the swap details and gas fees, confirm the trade, and wait for it to be processed on the blockchain.

By using either the Base network’s built-in swap feature or accessing a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, you have the flexibility to manage your assets the way you prefer.

## Part 3: Managing Your Wallet and Staying Secure

Now that you’ve made your first crypto trade, here are a few tips for managing your wallet securely:
- **Regularly back up your seed phrase**: Store your seed phrase in a secure location. Consider using multiple backups (e.g., a safe deposit box).
- **Monitor gas fees**: Gas fees can fluctuate, so always double-check them before confirming a transaction.
- **Be cautious with dApps**: Only connect your wallet to trusted decentralized applications. Be wary of phishing links and fake platforms.
- **Use two-factor authentication**: Although Coinbase Wallet doesn’t directly support 2FA, using a password manager and enabling 2FA on linked accounts (like your email) adds an extra layer of security.

By following this guide, you’ve not only set up your first self-custody wallet but also made your first decentralized crypto trade. Coinbase Wallet gives you the power to fully control your assets and participate in the rapidly expanding world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. Always keep your seed phrase safe, and as you grow more comfortable, explore advanced features like staking, lending, and more decentralized applications.
